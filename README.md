### Hi, I'm Ale!

A guy who has worked in the financial department of major Brazilian travel groups for the past 7 years and has now decided to work with development.

Today I am a cadet at 42 SÃ£o Paulo and I am finishing a Full Stack Web Development course at Digital House.

I can work with Visual Basic, Javascript, Node, HTML and CSS.

I'm currently studying React, Vue, Angular, C and Shell.


I've always had great ideas and now I'm working on a scalable and very profitable idea.

In addition I am building my portfolio, adding several simple projects, but that help to understand programming languages â€‹â€‹even more.



I also have a project of an exclusive travel agency for the gamer audience that went wrong because of the coronavirus pandemic and that I would be very happy to explain to someone who takes it off the ground and makes it happen.


To find me, just send a message through the social networks below:



See you later!!
